    "Notes:\n",
    "1. A labeled training set is a training set that contains the desired solution (a.k.a. a label) for each instance\n",
    "2. The two most common supervised tasks are regression and classification\n",
    "3. Common unsupervised tasks include clustering, visualization, dimensionality reduction, and association rule learning.\n",
    "4. If you don't know how to define the groups, then you can use a clustering algorithm (unsupervised learning) to segment your customers into clusters of similar customers. However, if you know what groups you would like to have, then you can feed many examples of each group to a classification algorithm (supervised learning), and it will classify all your customers into these groups.\n",
    "5. Spam detection is a typical supervised learning problem: the algorithm is fed many emails along with their labels (spam or not spam).\n",
    "6. A model has one or more model parameters that determine what it will predict given a new instance (e.g., the slope of a linear model). A learning algorithm tries to find optimal values for these parameters such that the model generalizes well to new instances. A hyperparameter is a parameter of the learning algorithm itself, not of the model (e.g., the amount of regularization to apply).\n",
    "7. We usually train such systems by minimizing a cost function that measures how bad the system is at making predictions on the training data, plus a penalty for model complexity if the model is regularized\n",
    "8. Some of the main challenges in Machine Learning are the lack of data, poor data quality, nonrepresentative data, uninformative features, excessively simple models that underfit the training data, and excessively complex models that overfit the data\n",
    "9. A test set is used to estimate the generalization error that a model will make on new instances, before the model is launched in production.\n",
    "10. A validation set is used to compare models. It makes it possible to select the best model and tune the hyperparameters.\n",
    "11. the train-dev set is used when there is a risk of mismatch between the training data and the data used in the validation and test datasets (which should always be as close as possible to the data used once the model is in production).\n",
    "12. : another source of randomness is the order of Python sets: it is based on Python's hash() function, which is randomly \"salted\" when Python starts up (this started in Python 3.3, to prevent some denial-of-service attacks). To remove this randomness, the solution is to set the PYTHONHASHSEED environment variable to \"0\" before Python even starts up. Nothing will happen if you do it after that. Luckily, if you're running this notebook on Colab, the variable is already set for you.\n",
    "13. If you have a training set with millions of features you can use Stochastic Gradient Descent or Mini-batch Gradient Descent, and perhaps Batch Gradient Descent if the training set fits in memory. But you cannot use the Normal Equation or the SVD approach because the computational complexity grows quickly (more than quadratically) with the number of features.\n",
    "14. Gradient Descent cannot get stuck in a local minimum when training a Logistic Regression model because the cost function is convex. Convex means that if you draw a straight line between any two points on the curve, the line never crosses the curve.\n",
    "15. If the validation error consistently goes up after every epoch, then one possibility is that the learning rate is too high and the algorithm is diverging. If the training error also goes up, then this is clearly the problem and you should reduce the learning rate. However, if the training error is not going up, then your model is overfitting the training set and you should stop training.\n",
    "16. If the validation error is much higher than the training error, this is likely because your model is overfitting the training set. One way to try to fix this is to reduce the polynomial degree: a model with fewer degrees of freedom is less likely to overfit. Another thing you can try is to regularize the model—for example, by adding an ℓ₂ penalty (Ridge) or an ℓ₁ penalty (Lasso) to the cost function. This will also reduce the degrees of freedom of the model. Lastly, you can try to increase the size of the training set.\n",
    "17. If both the training error and the validation error are almost equal and fairly high, the model is likely underfitting the training set, which means it has a high bias. You should try reducing the regularization hyperparameter α.\n",
    "18. Ridge Regression over plain Linear Regression.\n",
    "19. Lasso Regression uses an ℓ₁ penalty, which tends to push the weights down to exactly zero. This leads to sparse models, where all weights are zero except for the most important weights. This is a way to perform feature selection automatically, which is good if you suspect that only a few features actually matter. When you are not sure, you should prefer Ridge Regression.\n",
    "Elastic Net is generally preferred over Lasso since Lasso may behave erratically in some cases (when several features are strongly correlated or when there are more features than training instances). However, it does add an extra hyperparameter to tune. If you want Lasso without the erratic behavior, you can just use Elastic Net with an l1_ratio close to 1.\n",
